These data represent the abundance, biovolume, and biomass of
prokaryotic phytoplankton, eukaryotic pico- and nano- phytoplankton, and
heterotrophic bacteria from discrete flow cytometry samples collected
during the Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER)
Transect cruises, ongoing since 2018. Samples were collected and
preserved from the water column at multiple depths using Niskin bottles
on a CTD rosette system along the NES-LTER transect, and analyzed post
cruise. Cells were identified and enumerated from the flow cytometry
data files based on their scattering, SYBR (525 nm), phycoerythrin (575
nm) and chlorophyll (680 nm) fluorescence signals. Gating was completed
manually in the Attune NXT software interface.
